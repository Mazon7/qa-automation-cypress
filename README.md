QA Automation for Blockchain projects

There are a few projects (branches) in this repository that demonstrate the QA Automation scenarios (Backend/Frontend and Business Logic) developed with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and Javascript for Blockchain-related projects.
This aimed to give the viewer a brief introduction to how QA Automation processes can be realized using general approaches such as Page Object and others.

If you are looking to solve tasks related to Automation (QA, or other type) with Javascript and Cypress framework specifically you can find contact info **[here](https://github.com/Mazon7)** and find out more about my skills and experience!
